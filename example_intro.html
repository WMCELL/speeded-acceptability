<h1>INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE EXPERIMENT</h1>
<p>
In this experiment, you'll be reading sentences presented to you <b>one word at a time</b> at a fixed rate in the middle of the screen. 
  After the sentence has been displayed you will judge whether it was acceptable. <b>An "acceptable" sentence is a sentence that a native 
  speaker of English would say.</b> For example, here's an acceptable sentence:
</p>
<p>
<i>The professional photographer didn't imply that the fashion magazine had published tasteless photos.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Below is another example:
</p>
  <p>
<i>Frank wondered who he should play with.</i>
</p>
<p>
Even though a grade school English teacher might tell you that you can't end a sentence with a preposition, native speakers of 
  English do so all the time and it sounds perfectly natural. In fact, the "proper" version of that sentence sounds pretty weird: </p>
<p><i>Frank wondered with what he should eat.</i></p>
<p><b>An unacceptable sentence is one that no native speaker of English would produce</b>, even if it sort of makes sense. Here are some 
  examples of less acceptable sentences:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The meek boxer who trained with the persistent coach shockingly were brutal in the boxing ring.</i></li>
<li><i>The old rancher who listened to the dishonest salesman unsurprisingly isolated themselves in a huge ranch on the hill.</i></li>
<li><i>Frank thought about what he should eating later that afternoon when he got home from school.</i></li>
  
  </ul>
<p>
Sometimes you may feel unsure as to whether a sentence is acceptable, but you should just go with your first impression. 
  There are no wrong answers and no trick sentences, just make sure you understand what you read and go with your gut reaction. Do
  <em>NOT</em> rely on the length of the sentence to judge if it is good or bad. A complex sentence may be difficult to understand 
  at first, but there may be nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p><b>You'll indicate that a sentence is ACCEPTABLE by pressing the F key, or UNACCEPTABLE by pressing the J key.</b> You will only have 
  3 seconds to respond to each sentence, so you should keep your fingers on the F and J keys and respond as quickly as possible. 
<p>
We will first work through a few practice examples, and then we'll begin the actual task.  
  It's important that you pay close attention when the sentences are being presented to you, 
  because some of them are quite long.
